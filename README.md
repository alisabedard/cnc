# cnc
This is an open source CNC machine design.  

# State
This CNC is based on a CNC engraver I designed and built, currently hosted at my local makerspace.  The goal of this project is to refine the design based on the shortcomings of the original design.  It will serve as a build guide for future revisions of its physical implementation.  The budget for changes is limited, so the design will target maximum rigidity under a disciplined budget, using existing parts where possible.  I am open to suggestions and contributions, and I publish this with the hopes that it will be helpful to others.

# Dependencies
This requires the [openscad-openbuilds library](https://github.com/mazerte/openscad-openbuilds) by Mathieu Desv√©.  The [MCAD library](https://github.com/openscad/MCAD) is required.  These are both used as submodules, so be sure to initialize it.
